## ✈️ The Inspiration: A Traveler’s Nightmare

We’ve all heard the stories — a dream trip ruined by a single typo or an expired passport. Travel should be about adventure, not paperwork anxiety.  

This project was inspired by that frustration. It answers a simple question:

> *What if we could build a digital system so reliable and intelligent that passport issues are caught before they ever cause real-world problems?*

The **Passport Management System** is designed to ensure that every passport record is valid, secure, and correctly managed — from issuance to expiration.

## ⚙️ Core Features

This project goes beyond simple data storage. It models a professional-grade backend system that demonstrates **modern software engineering principles**.

- 🧱 **Immutable Data Models**  
  Once created, Passport objects cannot be modified, ensuring absolute data consistency and preventing corruption.

- 🧩 **Builder Design Pattern**  
  Passports are instantiated via a `Builder` pattern, validating all inputs (e.g., no future birthdates) before creation.

- 🧠 **Service-Oriented Architecture**  
  The `PassportOffice` class serves as the business logic layer, handling operations like issuing or revoking passports.

- 🗃️ **Singleton Database**  
  The `PassportDB` class simulates a shared in-memory database, guaranteeing a single, consistent data source across the application.

- 🚨 **Custom Exception Handling**  
  The `InvalidPassportDataException` class provides clear, precise error messages for invalid data.

- ✅ **Comprehensive Unit Testing**  
  Backed by **JUnit 5**, the system includes tests that verify integrity, exception handling, and business logic.

- 🔑 **UUID-Based ID Generation**  
  Every passport is assigned a unique UUID, mirroring modern secure identification practices.
